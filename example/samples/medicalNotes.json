This was apparently removed when she was 18. Last July she presented with more pain in this area. On exam, it was apparently unclear if there was a recurrence. She was put on a course of Keflex and everything resolved. She presents to walk-in today saying that same thing has happened. She has had a couple days of increased swelling in this area. No fevers. Mild pain. Bowel movements are fine.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 122/74, pulse 82. She is afebrile. We had a female nurse chaperone in the room during the exam. In the upper aspect of her gluteal cleft there were several scars from her prior surgery. This area was mildly indurated. There was absolutely no erythema or fluctuance and it was not tender at all. No drainage.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Possible recurrence of pilonidal cyst. We do not see any active evidence of an infection, but given her apparent response last July, we will give her another one-week course of Keflex. She will return to clinic if things do not resolve or if they get worse.\\n\\nNancy Student, MS3\\n\\nSeen with Joe Doctor, MD\\n\\n\"",

    "text": "\"Joseph R. Smith\\n\\n1234567-8\\n\\n4/5/2006\\n\\nREASON FOR VISIT:Here to get a new primary care physician.\\n\\nHPI: Mr. Smith is a 56-year-old gentleman formally followed at Carolina Premier who presents to obtain a new primary care physician secondary to insurance changes. He has a past medical history significant for a myocardial infarction in 1994. His cholesterol has been fine. Catheterization showed a possible \\\"kink\\\" in one of his vessels and it was thought that he had a possible \\\"eddy\\\" of current which led to a clot. He has been on Coumadin since then as well as a calcium channel blocker with the thought that there may have been a superimposed spasm. He has had several unremarkable stress tests since then. He works out on a Nordic-Track three times a week without any chest pain or shortness of breath. He has a history of possible peptic ulcer disease in 1981. He was treated with H2 blockers and his symptoms resolved. He has never had any bleeding to his knowledge. He had a hernia repair bilaterally in 1989 and surgery for a right knee cyst in 1999, all of which went well. He also has about a year long history of right buttock pain. This happens only when he is sitting for some time and does not change position. It does not happen when he is walking or exercising. He wonders if it might be pyriformis syndrome. If he changes positions frequently or stretches his legs, this seems to help. He has no acute complaints today and is here to get plugged into the system. He does wonder if there is anything else that can be done about his buttock pain.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. In addition, he had a flexible sigmoidoscopy in 2003 which was okay.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Tylenol p.r.n., baby aspirin p.o. q.d., Coumadin 3.5 mg p.o. q.d., Adalat Time Released tablets 30 mg one p.o. q.d., multivitamin, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate.\\n\\nALLERGIES: No Known Drug Allergies\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: His mother had diabetes developed at age 55 and coronary artery disease in her mid sixties. His father had CAD as well but not until his 70s. A paternal aunt had breast cancer. There is no history of colon or prostate cancer.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He lives in Durham with his wife and mother. He works for a biotech company. He does not smoke. He drinks two beers per night and reports no trouble with alcohol in the past. No history of drug use.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per his personal health summary and is significant only for his buttock pain as listed above, but is otherwise essentially unremarkable.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS: Weight 175.2 pounds which is 79.3 kg, blood pressure 142/96 by the nurse, 140/92 by me, pulse is 64.\\n\\nGENERAL: A healthy-appearing middle-aged gentleman.\\n\\nHEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.

No evidence for actual CAD. He will continue his aspirin and Coumadin. Unclear to exactly how long he should be on Coumadin or if this is really needed. At some point, may discuss this with cardiology. We will check an INR today and get him plugged into our Coumadin clinic. Check cholesterol.\\nHigh blood pressure.

    "text": "\"Richard L. Smith\\n\\n1234567-8\\n\\n4/5/2006\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Smith is a 63-year-old gentleman new to our Clinic. He had been followed by Dr. Jones at Kernodle Clinic. Mr. Smith has a past medical history that includes hypertension for more than five years. It sounds like he has fairly severe white coat hypertension. Apparently, he has home readings consistently 30 points below what he gets in the office. He had been on Capoten in the past and gotten a cough with that. He had been on Norvasc in the past, but then stopped it for unclear reasons. More recently, he has been on Hyzaar. He also has hypercholesterolemia and has been on Lipitor. He has for the past year or so felt that his hands and feet were \\\"burning up\\\" at night. He reports that \\\"he can almost see the heat waves from them.\\\" He thinks this is a medication side effect. On his own, he stopped his Lipitor three weeks ago. He has not noticed any difference in his symptoms. He otherwise feels well and has no complaints.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. 3. Status post plastic surgery after a motor vehicle collision when he was in his 20s. 4. History of depression around the time of the accident. He does report that intermittently he feels quite down, but he is able \\\"to pick himself back up\\\". More recently, however, he has been in a more prolonged period. 5. He has significant moles and he is followed by an outside dermatologist. 6. He has had normal PSA and rectal exams. He had a colonoscopy about five years ago and again one year ago, both of which showed many polyps, pathology not known.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Now only Hyzaar, a baby aspirin and a multivitamin\\n\\nALLERGIES: Capoten caused a cough.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He works in computer software. He does not smoke. He drinks wine and Martinis \\\"probably more than I need to.\\\" No drug use.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father died of a brain aneurysm in his 50s. Mom had colon cancer in her 80s and also hypertension. Five older sisters all with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. No known coronary artery disease.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\n\\nCONSTITUTIONAL: No fevers. Weight up 15 lbs since March. HEENT: Teeth doing okay. Does not feel congested in his sinuses. CARDIOVASCULAR: No chest pains, palpitations, PND, orthopnea or edema. RESPIRATORY: No shortness of breath. He does have a chronic intermittent cough that he has had for years. He had a chest x-ray a couple of years ago to evaluate this which was apparently normal. GI: No abdominal pain. No reflux-type symptoms. No change in bowel habits. GU: No hematuria or dysuria. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No chronic joint pains. PSYCHIATRIC: Not suicidal.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS: Weight 86.7 kg which is 191 lbs, blood pressure 174/114, pulse 103.\\n\\nHEENT: Conjunctivae pink. Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx clear.\\n\\nNECK: No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly or JVD.\\n\\nLUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion.\\n\\nHEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.\\n\\nABDOMEN: Normal bowel sounds. Soft, nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly.\\n\\nEXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.\\n\\nPSYCHIATRIC: Normal affect and behavior with seemingly good insight.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\\n\\nHypertension, poor control even with supposed white coat hypertension. He again is worried about side effect of his medications. We talked about many options and decided to change him to HCTA 25 mg a day and Norvasc 10 mg a day.\\nHypercholesterolemia. We will check lipid panel today. We will hold off on Lipitor for now, but will likely restart this once we confirm he is not having drug side effects. He is also interested in possibly trying fish oil.\\nPsychiatric. He was not interested in counseling at all. He was interested in medication. We will start Celexa 20 mg a day. He will titrate this up to 40 mg after three to four weeks. He will call us in a few weeks if he is having any problems.\\nHealth maintenance. We will hold on PSA screening for a bit as he has been screened in the past. We will repeat colonoscopy in a few years and will try to get records of prior polyp pathology. He will try to focus on drinking a bit less alcohol and getting some regular exercise and eating better. Continue baby aspirin.\\nReturn to clinic in two months.\\nJohn Student, MS3\\n\\nSeen with Joe Doctor, MD\\n\\n\"",

He reports doing well. He did have some more knee pain for a few weeks, but this has resolved. He is having more trouble with his sinuses. I had started him on Flonase back in December. He says this has not really helped. Over the past couple weeks he has had significant congestion and thick discharge. No fevers or headaches but does have diffuse upper right-sided teeth pain.

He reports he is overall doing well. He is not having any trouble with his medications. His blood pressures generally have been running around 140/90 at home. He has been having low back pain for the past 6 months. It is more on the right side and occurs intermittently throughout the day. No known initial precipitating event. He denies any radiation down his legs, any fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or bowel or bladder problems.

    "text": "\"Zachary A. Smith\\n\\n1234567-8\\n\\n4/5/2006\\n\\nHPI: Mr. Smith is a 46-year-old gentleman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, severe hand and feet dermatitis and tobacco abuse. He presents for follow-up of hospitalization at Rex. He presented 5 days ago with 24 hours of mid epigastric pain. This did go away with nitroglycerin in an urgent care clinic. EKG showed minimal Q-waves inferiorly. He ruled out. He had an exercise treadmill test, which showed 1 mm ST depression in the lateral leads without chest pain, but the test was limited by severe leg pain/claudication. He also had a chest x-ray, which showed a small nodular density posterior to the heart on the lateral view. It was felt to be probably a vessel seen on end. He was discharged on his usual medications to follow up here. Today, he reports he continues to feel well and that his midepigastric pain has not returned. Since I saw him last, he has started using his treadmill at home. He has not gotten any chest pain or midepigastric pain or shortness of breath with this, but has felt a burning in his calves. On the plus side, his dermatitis is doing the best that it has in more than 15 years. He is not sure why this is happening. He is also tapering down his smoking. He is down to a pack and a half a day. He is hoping to eventually quit.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Include atorvastatin 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg a day, amlodipine 10 mg a day, enalapril 20 mg a day, triamcinolone ointment.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: CARDIOVASCULAR: No palpitations, PND, orthopnea or edema. RESPIRATORY: No cough. GASTROINTESTINAL: No abdominal pain or change in bowel habits.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS: Weight is 100 kg, blood pressure is 114/75, pulse is 76. GENERAL: Looks well.\\n\\nLUNGS: Clear.\\n\\nHEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.\\n\\nABDOMEN: Normal active bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses\\n\\nEXTREMITIES: 1+ posterior tibialis bilaterally. Feet are warm and capillary refill a bit slow but still less than 2 seconds. Decreased hair.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\\n\\nMidepigastric pain. More likely GI in origin. Certainly with many atypical features for cardiovascular origin but he also has multiple risk factors for CAD, had tiny Q-waves, and an abnormal stress test. We will continue with his current cardiovascular medications, including aspirin, statin, ACE-inhibitor and calcium channel blocker. Will get a dobutamine echocardiogram.\\nProbable peripheral vascular disease. We will get duplex scan and ankle brachial index. Same meds as above. Continue exercise.\\nHe was strongly encouraged to continue to pursue his efforts to quit smoking.\\nPossible abnormal chest xray. Will repeat today.\\nReturn to clinic at his regular appointment in June. We will be in touch about his results before then.\\nJohn Student, MS3\\n\\nSeen with Joe Doctor, MD\\n\\n\"",
